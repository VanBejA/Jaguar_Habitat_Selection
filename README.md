## About the Repository
This repository contains all the R analyses associated with the research published in the article titled **The effect of anthropogenic features on the habitat selection of a large carnivore is conditional on sex and circadian period, suggesting a landscape of coexistence**. This study examines the impact of human-made structures on the habitat preferences of large carnivores, analyzing how these preferences vary by sex and time of day.

Due to the large size of environmental databases and some datasets, this repository includes only a sample of scripts to replicate parts of the study.

## Repository Contents
- **Analysis Scripts**: Scripts are used for statistical analysis and data processing.
- Since the Prepare the data and environmental variables to the Final model

We used the open resource: **Jaguar movement database: a GPS-based movement dataset of an apex predator in the Neotropics** 

## Usage
To use the scripts and data:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have R installed along with the necessary packages mentioned in the scripts.
3. Run the scripts in numerical order to replicate the analysis.
